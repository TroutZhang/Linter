# Linter

Currently WIP release of Linter.

@TODO:

* 4.27 patchups per community
* Compilation and release guide

# Trout's Note
the **main** branch will always track the upstream

the **ue5** branch of mine will not maintain any ue4 compatibility at all.

* I will try PR all mine changes to the upstream(which seems dead now?)
